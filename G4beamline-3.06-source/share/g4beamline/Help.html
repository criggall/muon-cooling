<H2>Downloading Geant4 Data Sets</H2>
<p> <b>NOTE:</b>Before G4beamline can run, it requires that various Geant4 
data sets be downloaded and unpacked; which specific data-sets are required
depends on the physics list used in the input.file. When first run, 
G4beamline prompts the user to download them. If you find you need to
download more data-sets, click <a href="file:/G4blData">here</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="Intro"></a>
</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
G4beamline is a particle-at-a-time simulation program based
on Geant4 <a href="#References">[1]</a> and optimized for the simulation of
beamlines. See the G4beamline User's Guide at the above URL for a
description of the program (it is also installed with this distribution in
the doc directory).
<p>
This brief description only discusses how to use the program, it does not
describe how to construct a simulation's input file; for that see the
G4beamline User's Guide.
<a name="Using"></a>
</p><h2>Using the Program</h2>
Select the input file using the "Browse" button above, or via the File/Open menu.
The directory containing it will become the current directory, and the
output file will be "g4bl.out", which will be displayed in this space.
Any additional Parameters used by the input file can be entered above.
Pushing the "Run" button above will run the program, replacing this
text with its output.<br>
<br>
If you wish, you can enter a simple directory name into the "Directory"
field; that directory will be created and the output files placed into
it (including any NTuple output files). No '/' or '\' can be used.<br>
 
<p>
While the program is running, the "Run" button above will change to
"Abort" to permit you to stop the program immediately. Closing this 
window will also abort g4beamline.
</p><p>
After running the simulation (with viewer=none), the simulation usually creates
one or more Root files containing the NTuples. You can use the 
<a href="#HistoRoot">HistoRoot</a> program to generate histograms from these
files.
</p><p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
With a viewer selected, NTuple output files are not written. This includes both
.root files and ASCII files from vitualdetector-s, zntuple-s, etc.
</p><p>Several examples are provided in the distribution. They are
located in the "examples" directory under the install directory. In
Linux the install directory is usually in your HOME directory; in Mac
OS X it is usually in /Applications; in Windows a Copy of "G4beamline
examples" is placed into "Documents". When installing G4beamline, it is
helpful to put the G4beamlineExamples directory into your HOME or Desktop.<br>

</p><p>
<a name="Vis"></a>
</p><h2>Visualizing the system</h2>Un-checking the Visualization box
will run the simulation and write the NTuple files; checking it will
run the simulation and viewer without writing NTuple files.
Each image in the viewer is a single run containing the selected number of
events.
<p>
viewer=best will visualize the system using OGLSQt, a viewer based on the Qt library and OpenGL. The number at the top left is the number of events per run;
each run will be shown as a separate image; push "Start Run" to start a run.
For usage hints, see the "useful tips" tab.
</p><p>Other viewers can be used, see the View/Other menu item for details.</p>
<a name="HistoRoot"></a>
<h2>Using HistoRoot to Create Histograms</h2>
<P>G4beamline often generates Root files containing NTuples; it can also
generate ASCII files containing those NTuples. The Root program 
<a href="#References">[2]</a> can be used to analyze these files, generate
plots and histograms, etc.
</P><P>
Root is very general, and therefore quite complex; understanding C++
programming is essential to be able to use it directly.
The HistoRoot program makes it easy to generate plots and histograms from
Root and ASCII files containing NTuples. It is a GUI program implemented in
Root that requires no C++ programming by users. HistoRoot is available at
http://historoot.muonsinc.com;
it requires the spedific version of Root from that webpage.
G4beamline can create .root files without Root being installed, and you can
install Root and/or HistoRoot after generating them, if necessary.

absorber     construct an absorber

             The absorber has two windows with beampipe and an absorber
             material. Optionally it has an additional two safety windows with
             beampipe. The WindowShape(s) are read from a file, and they
             determine the thickness and length of the beampipe(s). For
             geometry testing, acts like a cylinder enclosing the windows. For
             placing children, acts like a cylinder inside the central
             absorber.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.
             
             Note that section 4.5 of the User's Guide has a dimensioned
             drawing of an absorber.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             absWindow     The name of the absorber window. #
             safetyWindow  The name of the safety window. #
             insideLength  Absorber length inside windows (mm) #
             absMaterial   The material of the absorber #
             windowMaterial The material of the window(s) #
             safetyMaterial The material inside the safety windows. #
             safetyDistance Distance between absorber and safety windows(mm) #
             color         The color of the absorber (''=invisible)
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)

beam         Define the Beam.

             The beam command is: beam type arg1=v1 ...
             
             Types are: gaussian, rectangular, ellipse, ascii, and root.
             
             Gaussian beams are randomly generated to emanate from
             beamX,beamY,beamZ with the given sigmas; negative sigma means
             flat with |sigma| as halfwidth.
             
             Rectangular beams are randomly generated to emanate from the
             rectangle beamHeight by beamWidth centered at beamX,beamY,beamZ.
             
             Ellipse beams are randomly generated on the ellipses in (X,Xp),
             (Y,Yp), (T,E), with meanE determined from meanP and the sigmas
             used as half-widths; tracks are generated on the ellipse with
             uniform density when plotted with scales such that the ellipse is
             a circle.
             
             ASCII beams are read from a file using the format specified; the
             formats supported are: BLTrackFile2. The value of polarization in
             the file overwrites the value from the command line. Note the
             original BLTrackFile format is supported, but the additional
             fields are not present. Note also that properTime, pathLength,
             initialPosition, initialT, and initialKE are for THIS simulation,
             and their values in the file are ignored.
             
             Root beams are read from a .root file using the TNtuple named
             directory/name in the file. It must have the same fields as used
             in BLTrackFile2 format. Note that EventIDs greater than
             16,777,216 will be rounded.
             
             When reading a file (ascii or root), beamX and beamY are added to
             input tracks; if beamZ is set it will overwrite the z of the
             track, but if it is not set the z of the track in the file is
             kept.
             
             All coordinates are centerline coordinates.
             
             Multiple beam commands can be given, and they will generate
             events in the order they appear in input.file.
             
             Events are generated starting at firstEvent, until either nEvents
             have been generated or lastEvent would be exceeded.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.
             
             Beam tracks with momentum=0 will take one step as a stoppd
             particle (as desired).
             
             For gaussian, rectangular, and ellipse beams, the beam particle
             can be given as either a particle name or its integer PDGid. Some
             common beam particle names are: proton, anti_proton, pi+, pi-,
             mu+, mu-, e+, e-, kaon+, kaon-, kaon0, nu_e, anti_nu_e. See the
             User's Guide for a complete list of particle names; ions can also
             be specified by integer PDGid.
             
             Ions are supported as beam particles, but only fully-ionized
             ions, and not for Root input (a Root NTuple field cannot hold the
             PDGid). Ions are specified by an integer PDGid=100ZZZAAA0, where
             ZZZ is the 3-digit charge (# protons), and AAA is the 3-digit
             atomic number. Note you must use physics processes appropriate
             for ions.

boolean      Construct an element from a boolean operation between elements.

             This command takes a pair of simple elements and creates a new
             element that is a boolean operation between the solids of the
             initial elements. Boolean operations are: union, subtraction, and
             intersection. Simple elements are those consisting of a single
             solid, with no EM field: boolean, box, extrusion, polycone
             sphere, tessellatedsolid, torus, trap, tubs.
             
             The command is:
                 boolean op=subtraction e3 e1 e2 [args...]
             This creates element e3 from the subtraction of e2 from e1. e1,
             e2, and e3 can be used in further boolean operations, or can be
             placed into the world.
             
             The local coordinates of the new element are those of the first
             element. If material is not specified, the material of the first
             element is used.
             
             The two input solids should intersect, and the resulting solid
             should be a single piece; if not the results are undefined.
             
             Note that for op=subtraction, the two elements should not share
             any common faces; to create a hole, the subtracted (second)
             element should extend at least a micron outside the first
             element.
             
             The values of width, height, and length default to those of e1.
             If taht is not correct, provide the correct values as arguments.
             
             Note also that visualization of boolean solids may not work
             properly, except for the RayTracer viewer. Tracking is fine.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command).

             Named Arguments:
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize (mm).
             material      The material of the boolean.
             color         The color of the boolean (white).
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.
             op            The boolean operation (union, subtraction, or
                           intersection).
             x             The x offset of element2 relative to element1 (mm).
             y             The y offset of element2 relative to element1 (mm).
             z             The z offset of element2 relative to element1 (mm).
             rotation      The rotation of element2 ('').

box          construct a box.

             This is a direct interface to G4Box.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.
             

             Named Arguments:
             height        The height of the box (mm).
             width         The width of the box (mm).
             length        The length of the box (mm).
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm).
             material      The material of the box.
             color         The color of the box (''=invisible).
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.

bug1021      Workaround to improve accuracy of bug1021 in E field

             When a charged particle turns around in an E field, a bug in the
             Geant4 transportation process can sometimes give it a
             wildly-incorrect kinetic energy. This workaround computes the
             distance to turn-around, and limits the step to half that vlue
             until minStep is reached; at that point the track is reflected.
             
             Simulations in which there are no E fields, or no charged
             particle ever gets below ~0.001 MeV in an E field, have no need
             to apply this workaround.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             minStep       Minimum step in space (mm, default=0.002)

coil         defines a coil (part of a solenoid)

             A coil is a geometrical tube that can carry current when part of
             a solenoid. The field is computed for a set of nSheets
             infinitely-thin current sheets evenly spread radially. The
             solenoid specifies the actual current. For tracking the
             computation is too slow, so a field map on a grid in r and z is
             computed and written to filename (defaults to coilname.dat).
             While there are lots of parameters specifying the field map it is
             recommended to simply accept the defaults for all but
             innerRadius, outerRadius, length, material, and possibly
             tolerance. The other parameters will be determined so that the
             largest error is less than tolerance times the value of Bz at the
             center of the coil. If mapFile is given, the file is read in
             BLFieldMap format. The cache file contains the parameters, and is
             a field map in a binary format; it is automatically regenerated
             if any parameter changes.
             
             Note that maxR and maxZ are by default determined to be large
             enough so that the field falls below tolerance; this can be quote
             large.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             innerRadius   Inside radius of the coil (mm) #
             outerRadius   Outside radius of the coil (mm) #
             length        Length of the coil along z (mm) #
             material      The material of the conductor (default=Cu) #
             tolerance     The acceptable tolerance of the map. #
             nSheets       Number of sheets used in the computation #
             maxR          Maxmum r value for the map (automatically
                           determined by default). #
             maxZ          Maxmum z value for the map (automatically
                           determined by default). #
             dR            R interval between points of the map (automatically
                           determined by default). #
             dZ            Z interval between points of the map (automatically

             filename      Filename for cache; deaults to name.dat. #
             mapFile       Filename for map (e.g. from TOSCA). #

                           any field map (0).

collective   Monitor collective computation

             This command computes the means and sigmas related to the time
             stepping in BLRunManager (global coordinates), generating a
             TimeStep NTuple. If the simulation has multiple bunches, this
             NTuple combines them all (and is thus almost useless).
             
             This command can also generate field NTuple-s at specified points
             in x,y,z -- unnamed parameters should be 'x,y,z' values for
             monitoring E and B fields (global coordinates).
             
             NOTE: This command must come AFTER other commands that compute
             collective fields; otherwise stale field values will be used from
             the previous time step. If deltaT is set &gt; 0.0, this command will
             put the RunManager into collective mode and set its deltaT;
             otherwise the previous commands should do that, and this command
             won't modify deltaT.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             deltaT        Time step (-1 ns).
             format        Format of NTuples.
             filenamePrefix Prefix of NTuple filenames.

corner       Implement a corner in the centerline.

             The centerline is bent by a rotation. Every track that enters the
             volume also gets rotated. The z value is for the corner and the
             front face of the volume (if any). If the corner is paired with a
             bending magnet or other mechanism to bend the beam, no volume
             should be used.
             
             NOTE: This command is self-placing, do not use the place command;
             it also affects all following placements, and it cannot be issued
             inside a group. If radius=height=width=0 then no volume is
             associated with the corner, and a bending magnet should be placed
             nearby to bend the particles around the corner. Normally the
             bending magnet is placed before the corner, and is rotated by
             half the bend angle. For a sector bend, it's usually best to use
             the cornerarc command rather than this one.
             
             NOTE: all placements before this command must have z values
             before the corner, and all placements after this command must
             have z values after the corner. Note also that the angle is
             limited to 90 degrees.
             
             Note that the radiusCut is important to reduce or eliminate
             ambiguities in the global to centerline coordinate transform. It
             can also be used to 'shield' the beamline to prevent particles
             from taking unusual paths around the outside of beamline
             elements.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             z             The centerline Z of the corner (mm).
             rotation      The rotation of the corner (see above).
             radiusCut     The radius cut for this following segment (mm
                           default=previous).
             radius        The radius of the circular corner volume (mm).
             height        The height of the rectangular corner volume (mm).
             width         The width of the rectangular corner volume (mm).
             length        The length of the corner volume (mm).
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm).
             material      The material of the corner volume.
             color         The color of the corner volume (''=invisible).

cornerarc    Implement a cornerarc in the centerline.

             The centerline is bent by a rotation. Three corners are used to
             approximate an arc; the total angle and path-length are equal to
             those for the arc. Should be used immediately after an
             idealsectorbend or a genericbend. The z value is for the front
             face of the arc.
             
             NOTE: This command is self-placing, do not use the place command;
             it also affects all following placements, and it cannot be issued
             inside a group.
             
             This command is well matched to a sector bend, but can also be
             used with a normal bending magnet -- normally the magnet is
             placed before the cornerarc and is rotated by half the bend
             angle.
             
             The only useful rotations are those around the centerline Z.
             
             z, angle, and centerRadius are required parameters.
             
             NOTE: all placements before this command must have z values
             before the corner, and all placements after this command must
             have z values after the corner. Note also that the angle is
             limited to 90 degrees.
             
             Note that the radiusCut is important to reduce or eliminate
             ambiguities in the global to centerline coordinate transform. It
             can also be used to 'shield' the beamline to prevent particles
             from taking unusual paths around the outside of beamline
             elements.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.
             
             Note that section 4.6 of the User's Guide has a dimensioned
             drawing of a cornerarc.

             Named Arguments:
             z             The centerline Z of the cornerarc (mm).
             centerRadius  The radius of the centerline arc (mm).
             angle         The angle of bend, &gt;0=left, &lt;0=right (degrees).
             rotation      The rotation of the cornerarc (see above).
             radiusCut     The radius cut for this following segment (mm).

cosmicraybeam Define a Cosmic-Ray muon 'beam'.

             The muon beam is nominally headed in the +Z direction, implying
             that +Z is physically DOWN. The beam intersects a box defined by
             beamWidth, beamHeight, and beamLength, centered at X=Y=0 and
             beamZ. For each event a point is selected randomly within this
             box, angles theta and phi and the muon momentum are generated
             according to a fit to their sea-level distributions, the track is
             extended backwards to the 'celestial sphere', and that is the
             initial beam position for the event. The muon flux through the
             rectangle at Z=beamZ is used to display an estimate of the
             sea-level exposure time for the run.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             nEvents       Number of events to process
             beamZ         Beam location in Z (mm)
             radius        Radius of celestial sphere (mm)
             beamHeight    Rectangular Beam height (mm)
             beamWidth     Rectangular Beam width (mm)
             beamLength    Rectangular Beam length (mm)

cylinder     Alias for 'tubs'.


define       defines a macro (argument-expanded set of commands).

             The first argument is the macro name, additional arguments become
             lines in the body of the expanded macro. The macro name becomes a
             command with up to 9 positional arguments. When the command is
             issued, the body is expanded and executed, with these
             substitutions:
               $0     MacroName
               $1-$9  Positional arguments of the command
               $#     # macro expansions (for generating unique names)
             NOTE: $paramname is expanded in the define command, but
             $$paramname is expanded when the macro is invoked.

demo         demo command.

             This demo command takes both positional and named args, and is
             the prototype class for all commands. All argument values are
             merely displayed. 'demo default name=value...' sets default
             values.

             Named Arguments:
             s1            a demo string argument.
             s2            a demo string argument.
             d1            a demo double argument.
             d2            a demo double argument.

detector     Construct a Detector that generates an NTuple.

             A Detector generates an NTuple of tracks when they enter the
             physical volume of the Detector, summing up the total energy
             deposited until it leaves the volume. By default an entry in the
             NTuple is generated for each event, with the track variables set
             by the first track as it enters the detector. Set perTrack=1 to
             generate an entry for each track.
             
             A detector may be placed via multiple place commands (usually
             with a 'rename=det#' argument to distinguish the different
             placements). Each placement creates an individual NTuple.
             
             If material is not specified, it uses Scintillator.
             
             There are three ways to specify the geometry:
              * set solid to the name of an existing solid.
              * set height, width, and length to get a rectangular box.
              * set radius and length (and innerRadius) to get a cylinder
                (tube).
             By using the solid argument you can make a detector out of any
             solid, including sphere, boolean, and extrusion.
             
             The NTuple by default uses local coordinates.
             
             The NTuple of the detector can be included in an ntuple command
             by including a pattern that matches its name in the 'detectors'
             argument to the ntuple command. Note that must match the name as
             placed (i.e. includes rename=), not the name given to this
             command. The noSingles argument may be useful in this case to
             avoid a huge NTuple of singles (an empty NTuple may be created).
             
             Note that secondary particles created within the detector will
             not get an entry until they have taken one step. They are
             guaranteed to do so.
             
             For VisibleEdep, this command knows the Birks constants for
             Scintillator, POLYSTYRENE, BGO, and lAr. For other materials you
             must supply a value, or 0.0 will be used.

             command in a single-line if.

elementdb    Generates the Element.db file from internal data.


emfactor     Multiply multiple scattering and energy loss by factors.

             The multiple scattering and ionization energy loss processes are
             not really independent; the msc factor applies to scattering in
             both, and the eLoss factor applies to the fluctuations of energy
             loss in both. The 'mean' energy loss is not affected; note that
             in some EM models, including the one used for muons, the
             fluctuations only increase the loss from the 'mean', so the
             average energy loss is affected, but only slightly.
             
             The deltaRay parameter is the probability of keeping any given
             delta-ray. The 3-momentum of each discarded delta-ray is added
             back into the particle's 3-momentum, and its K.E. is recomputed.
             
             Note that with msc=0 tracks can still be scattered if deltaRay&gt;0.
             
             This command applies ONLY to multiple scattering and ionization
             energy loss. Other processes still apply, which can scatter and
             cause a reduction of the track's energy. For muons you may wish
             to disable these processes (in the physics command): muBrems,
             muPairProd, CoulombScat, Decay; similarly for other particles.
             
             Problems may occur if any factor is &gt; 1.0; in particular, the
             position may be wrong - it might even cross a volume boundary
             illegally, causing major tracking errors (code is optimized for
             0.0 &lt;= msc,eLoss,DeltaRay &lt;= 1.0).

             Named Arguments:
             particle      Comma-separated list of particle names or patterns
                           (default=none).
             msc           Ratio for multiple scattering (1.0).
             eLoss         Ratio for ionization energy loss fluctuations
                           (1.0).
             deltaRay      Probability to keep delta-rays (1.0).
             Eloss         Synonym for eLoss.
             eloss         Synonym for eLoss.

endgroup     ends a group definition.

             The group may then be placed as any other element. If the group
             was not given a length via an argument, endgroup computes the
             length and adjusts the offsets of all elements in the group so
             they refer to the center of the group.

eventcuts    Implements cuts on event number via lists in files.

             The files are ASCII, with one event number per line. If the keep
             file is not empty, only event numbers listed in it will be
             analyzed (except those listed in the skip file). The skip file
             lists event numbers that will be skipped, and event numbers
             listed in both files will be skipped. When reading the files,
             lines beginning with '#' are ignored; blank lines are interpreted
             as event 0.

             Named Arguments:
             keep          The file containing a list of event numbers to
                           analyze (default is all).
             skip          The file containing a list of event numbers to
                           skip.
             filename      Synonym for keep.
             file          Synonym for keep.

exit         exit a command file.

             The exit command ceases reading the input file, and starts the
             simulation immediately (ignoring the remainder of the input
             file).

expandworld  Expand the world to include specified points.

             Each positional argument is x,y,z of a single point (global
             coordinates). The world will be expanded to include them all.

extrusion    construct a solid extrusion with axis along z

             This is a basic interface to G4ExtrudedSolid. A simple polygon in
             the X-Y plane is extruded along z, with optional scales in XY at
             the two ends (which generate a linear scaling along z).
             
             The polygon must be simple (no two sides intersect, no two
             vertices are equal). The vertices are listed starting from any
             vertex and traversing the polygon in either direction without
             lifting the pencil from the paper (Geant4 requires the traversal
             to be clockwise but this element internally reverses it if
             required). For an N-sided polygon give N vertices -- a side will
             be added from last to first to close the polygon; N is determined
             by counting the entries in the vertices argument.
             
             Note that while you cannot make an extrusion with a hole, you can
             make such an object in two parts or by placing a daughter volume
             in this one.
             
             Note the position placed is x=0,y=0,z=0, which is centered along
             z, but need not be near the center of the polygon in XY.
             
             With scale1!=scale2 this is not really an extrusion; by making
             one of them 0.001 or so, you can construct a sharp apex.
             
             Any x or y value in vertices can be an expression using double
             constants and the usual C operators and functions.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             length        Length of the extrusion (mm). #
             vertices      List of vertices of the XY polygon (mm):
                           'x0,y0;x1,y1;...'; a line from last to first is
                           added. A 2 mm square is: '-1,-1;-1,1;1,1;1,-1' #
             scale1        The XY scale at the upstream (-z) end (1.0). #
             scale2        The XY scale at the downstream (+z) end (1.0). #
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             material      The material of the extrusion
             color         The color of the extrusion (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.
             vertexes      Synonym for vertices. #

fieldexpr    implements a field map, E and/or B, from expressions.

             A fieldexpr element can be either a box or a cylinder; set length
             and radius for cylinder, set length and width and height for a
             box. Units are Tesla, MegaVolts/meter, mm, and ns. Expressions
             for the field components can use {x,y,z} for a box or {z,r} for a
             cylinder; the time expression can use {t}. If present, the time
             expression multiples all components.
             
             Expressions can use all C operators except ?:, and x^n is x to
             the nth power (n integer). The following functions are available:
             abs(), min(),max(), sqrt(), pow(), sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(),
             acos(), atan(), atan2(), sinh(), cosh(), tanh(), exp(), log(),
             log10(), floor(), ceil(), if(). if(condition,a,b) replaces the C
             (condition? a : b).
             
             A field map is used for tracking efficiency; the number of points
             in the map is increased until the largest map error divided by
             the maximum field is smaller than tolerance, or 1M points is
             exceeded. Similarly for the time dependence.
             
             For time dependence: if t-timeOffset&lt;tmin, the value at tmin is
             used; if t-timeOffset&gt;tmax, the value at tmax is used.
             
             Note that divide by zero is reported as invalid expression. For a
             Li lens you probably want to use an expression like this:
             'if(r&lt;100,500.0*r/100,500.0*100/r)', where 100mm is the radius,
             and 500T is the field at r=100mm.
             
             This field must be placed (via the place command); that specifies
             where (x=0,y=0,z=0) of the map is located in the parent. Note
             that front=1 can be used to place this field.

fieldlines   Display magnetic field lines.

             Field lines are drawn starting within a circle specified as
             center and radius (global coordinates); the plane of the circle
             is normal to the B field at its center. Field lines are
             distributed within the circle with a density inversely
             proportional to |B|. While it is attempted to keep their spacing
             as uniform as possible, there are both ambiguity and randomness
             involved in placing the lines within the circle. Lines are placed
             within the circle from its center outward, and if |B|&lt;minField
             then no more lines are placed.
             
             nLines is only approximate, and the actual number of lines drawn
             will be within a factor of 2 of the value. Asking for fewer than
             10 or more than 1000 lines is likely to be ineffective. Unnamed
             parameters can contain specific x,y,z values of points to start a
             field line.
             
             Lines are drawn in both directions starting from the plane of the
             circle, and each half-line stops when it again reaches that
             plane. Line drawing also stops whenever |B| is less than minField
             or when it leaves the world. If you are interested in field lines
             far outside the magnets, you may need to add some object with a
             large value of x, y, and/or z, in order to expand the world
             volume. With dl=1 and subdivide=10, the accuracy of their meeting
             is usually better than 0.1 mm after several tens of meters.
             
             This command does nothing if not in visualization mode. For best
             results, use the Open Inventor viewer, and give your magnets a
             transparency of about 0.3 (e.g. color=1,1,1,0.3); if necessary,
             use the right-button menu to set the DrawStyle/TransparencyType
             to 'sorted object add'. With field lines in 3-d, you will want
             the ability to zoom, rotate, and move the image interactively.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

fieldntuple  Generates an NTuple from B and E fields at specified points.

             Intended primarily for debugging. This command makes it easy to
             plot fields as a function of position and time, using existing
             NTuple plotting tools. Outputs x,y,z,t,Bx,By,Bz,Ex,Ey,Ez into an
             NTuple. Units are mm, ns, Tesla, and MegaVolts/meter. Runs after
             the reference particle is tracked. Only global coordinates are
             used.
             
             The single positional argument is the name of the NTuple. Named
             arguments {x,y,z,t} are of two forms specifying coordinate
             values: x=Xmin,Xmax,dX or x=X1:X2:X3:... which generate the
             obvious loops (single value is OK). Expressions can be used.
             Omitted coordinates are held fixed at 0.0.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             category      The category of the NTuple.
             format        NTuple format (see above for list).
             filename      Name of file.
             x             Loop for x values: Xmin,Xmaz,dX or X1:X2:... (mm)
             y             Loop for y values: Ymin,Ymaz,dY or Y1:Y2:... (mm)
             z             Loop for z values: Zmin,Zmaz,dZ or Z1:Z2:... (mm)
             t             Loop for t values: Tmin,Tmaz,dT or T1:T2:... (ns)
             exit          Set nonzero to exit after generating NTuple (0).
             file          Synonym for filename.

for          For loop.

             Syntax:
                 for i v1 v2 v3 ...
                     commands ...
                 endfor
             
             Sets the parameter i to values v1, v2, v3, ..., and executes the
             commands. Values can be any strings, including numbers, except
             they cannot contain an '=' (named parameter). After completion, i
             retains its last value.
             
             Do-s, for-s, and multi-line if-s can be nested in any manner.
             
             Note: the for command will not work from standard-input or as a
             command in a single-line if.

g4ui         Accesses the Geant4 user interface

             Each positional argument is executed as a Geant4 UI command,
             according to the when parameter. No positional arguments means
             open a UI session on stdout/stdin. For a given value of when, the
             UI commands from all g4ui commands are executed in order.

             Named Arguments:
             when          0=before reference, 1=before beam, 2=after beam,
                           3=cannot be used, 4=visualization.

genericbend  construct a generic bending magnet.

             The field region is a box with By specified. A fringe field
             computation based on the method of COSY INFINITY is included by
             default, extending the field in a rectangle extending the
             straight aperture along the local z. This is first order only,
             and assumes the magnet is infinitely wide; the fringe field
             extends outside of the magnet aperture only in a region extending
             the aperture in x and y. As the fringe field is first order only,
             it is slightly non-Maxwellian. It is calculated using Enge
             functions.
             
             Note that there is no field inside the 'iron'; this can result in
             gross tracking errors for particles in the iron, and implies that
             kill=1 is desirable.
             
             By default, the aperture is filled with a box volume of the
             fieldMaterial; this prevents placing any object inside the
             aperture. With openAperture=1 no aperture volume is used, and
             objects can be placed into the parent volume that are inside the
             aperture.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.
             
             If ironLength&lt;=0, ironWidth&lt;=0, or ironHeight&lt;=0, no iron is
             used.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd) (@=Tunable):

             fringe        Fringe field computation, set to 0 to disable, or a
                           comma-separated list of 6 Enge function parameters.
             fringeFactor  Fringe depth factor (1.0).
             openAperture  Set nonzero to omit the aperture volume. #

genericquad  construct a generic quadrupole magnet.

             The field region is a tubs with gradient specified. A positive
             gradient yields a horizontally-focusing quad for positive
             particles. If apertureRadius&gt;0 the quad has a circular aperture.
             For a 'rounded +' aperture using circles for the poles, set
             poleTipRadius, coilRadius, coilHalfwidth. Due to visualization
             bugs, in the latter case you cannot see through the aperture; it
             is solid black. A fringe field computation based on the method of
             COSY INFINITY is included by default, extending the field region.
             This is first order only, and the fringe field extends outside of
             the magnet aperture only in a cylinder extending the aperture
             straight along local z. As the fringe field is first order only,
             it is slightly non-Maxwellian. It is computed using Enge
             functions.
             
             Note that there is no field inside the 'iron'; this can result in
             gross tracking errors for particles in the iron, and implies that
             kill=1 is desirable.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.
             
             If ironLength &lt;= 0, no iron is constructed.
             
             Note that section 4.7 of the user's Guide has a dimensioned
             drawing of the genericquad aperture.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):

genericsectorbend construct an generic sector bending magnet.

             The field region is a sector with multi-function field specified.
             For straight magnets set fieldRadius=-1. Unlike most Elements,
             the position of the genericsectorbend is the center of the front
             face of its field (aperture). angle&gt;0 bends to the left around Y;
             angle&lt;0 bends right. The only useful rotations are around the
             centerline Z. This element should normally be followed
             immediately by a cornerarc. Note that -90&lt;=angle&lt;=90 degrees.
             
             Note that there is no field inside the 'iron'; this can result in
             gross tracking errors for particles in the iron, and implies that
             kill=1 is desirable.
             

             Named Arguments:

                           enable.
             fringeFactor  Fringe depth factor (1.0).

geometry     Arranges to perform a geometry test.

             The geometry test checks nPoints points on the surface of each
             element, verifying that they are inside the parent element and
             that they are not inside any sibling element. The default of 100
             points is usually sufficient; 0 means omit the geometry test. The
             first 10-40 points (depending on element) test 'corners', the
             rest are randomly distributed on the surface. The default
             tolerance is 0.002 mm.
             
             Points which fail are identified with a visible marker. set
             visible=1 to put a green marker at all tested points.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             

             Named Arguments:
             nPoints       The number of surface points to test per element
             printGeometry Set nonzero to print the entire geometry.
             visual        Set nonzero to display the geometry test points.
             tolerance     Tolerance for inside/outside tests (mm).

group        begins definition of a group.

             A group is a collection of elements that can be placed together,
             preserving their relative positions. The group is a LogicalVolume
             in the geant4 geometry -- this means that a group cannot overlap
             any other group or object, even if the overlapping portion of the
             group is empty. If you need to permit overlaps, consider using a
             macro instead (the define command).
             
             If the group is given a length, then children can be placed at
             specific z offsets relative to the center of the group. If the
             group is not given a length, then children can only be placed
             sequentially along z, and the length will be computed by the
             endgroup command. Width and height are computed from the largest
             child or the argument. If radius is set to 0, the group will be a
             cylinder with radius determined by the largest width or height
             placed into it; if &gt;0 then that is the fixed radius. If radius is
             not set then a box is used.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command).
             
             Note: when placing objects into a group, if the rename argument
             is used, it should begin with a '+' to include the group's name
             in the object's name; otherwise there may be multiple objects
             with the same name -- this is only a major problem for
             virtualdetector-s and other output objects. The group's name is
             included by default if no rename is used on the place command.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             length        Overall group length along z (mm) #

             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the volume (mm)

helicaldipole construct a helicaldipole magnet.

             The field region is a cylinder with a helical dipole field plus a
             solenoid field. The simple model=1 provides just a sine and
             cosine transverse dependence, while the maxwellian model=2 has
             both dipole and quadrupole terms. Both the dipole scale bD [T]
             and quadrupole scale bQ [T/m] are now at rho=0; the user must
             determine the correct values externally.
             
             Note that this Element generates a magnetic field only, and only
             within the cylinder defined by length and radius. So it has no
             solid associated with it, and is invisible.

             Named Arguments:

                           (GV/m).

helicalharmonic construct a helicalharmonic magnet.

             Creates a cylindrical region containing the field of a magnetic
             helical harmonic of given order [n]. The field is defined by the
             value of the (n-1) order derivative [b] of the vertical field
             component (when the initial phase is 0) with respect to the
             horizontal coordinate at the center of the helix:
               b=d^(n-1)B_phi/dr^(n-1) @ [r=0 &amp; phi-k*z+phi0=0], 
             where k=2*pi/lambda is the helix's wave number, [lambda] is the
             length of the helix's period, and phi0 is the initial phase. The
             field components in the cylindrical frame are given by:
               B_phi=(2/(n*k))^(n-1)*b*(I[n-1](n*k*r)-I[n+1](n*k*r))* 
                     cos(n*(phi-k*z+phi0)), 
               B_r  =(2/(n*k))^(n-1)*b*(I[n-1](n*k*r)+I[n+1](n*k*r))* 
                     sin(n*(phi-k*z+phi0)), 
               B_z  =-2*(2/(n*k))^(n-1)*b*I[n](n*k*r)*cos(n*(phi-k*z+phi0)), 
             where I[n](x) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind
             of order [n].
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command).
             
             Note that this Element generates magnetic field only, and only
             within the cylinder defined by length and radius. So it has no
             solid associated with it, and is invisible.

             Named Arguments:
             radius        The radius of the field region (mm)
             length        The length of the field region (mm)
             n             Order of helical harmonic (i.e. n=1 for dipole)
             b             (n-1)-order derivative of the field at the center
                           (T/m^(n-1))
             lambda        Helix period along the Z axis (mm).
             phi0          The phase of the XY field at the entrance (rad).

help         provides interactive help.

             help with no arguments lists all commands. 'help command' gives
             more detailed help on that command. 'help *' gives detailed help
             for all commands. If the first argument is -exit the program will
             exit after printing the help.

idealsectorbend construct an ideal sector bending magnet.

             The field region is a sector with By specified. Unlike most
             Elements, the position of the idealsectorbend is the center of
             the front face of its field (aperture). angle&gt;0 bends to the left
             around Y; angle&lt;0 bends right. The only useful rotations are
             around the centerline Z. This element should normally be followed
             immediately by a cornerarc. Note that -90&lt;=angle&lt;=90 degrees.
             
             No fringe fields are implemented.
             
             if ironHeight&lt;=0, no iron is generated.
             
             Note that there is no field inside the 'iron'; this can result in
             gross tracking errors for particles in the iron, and implies that
             kill=1 is desirable.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

                     CMD3 ...
                 endif
             
             The commands are executed in the usual way; elseif and else are
             optional, but endif is mandatory. Any number of elseif-s and
             commannds can be used. Do-s, for-s, and multi-line if-s can be
             nested in any manner.

label        Display labels, markers, or polylines visually in 3-D space.

             Each positional argument is X,Y,Z of the position; as many
             positions as desired can be used. The same text is displayed at
             each position. Empty text means use a circular marker; line=1
             means draw a polyline.

             The default height of text is 12 pixels; the default diameter of
             markers is 5 pixels; some viewers have rather narrow limits on
             sizes.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry, it only draws.
             
             Coordinates can be either centerline or global (the default).

list         provides interactive list of interesting internal tables.

             list with no arguments lists all lists except processes. 'list
             name' lists that specific one. 'list -exit name(s)' will exit
             after listing. List names are:
                 commands    all commands
                 materials   currently known materials
                 physics     all physics lists
                 particles   currently known particles

             NOTE: the particles and processes lists are not populated until
             the physics list is selected (via the physics command). Different
             physics lists use different processes and particles.
             
             ***NOTE: listing processes will prevent any simulating, as will a
             non-empty particle list.

             Named Arguments:

man          Alias for 'help'.


material     construct a new material.

             This is an interface to G4Material. This command is rarely
             required, because elements and most common materials are
             available via the NIST database. Any material available from the
             NIST database can simply be used -- if it is unknown then it will
             be automatically defined from the database. Uncommon materials or
             nonstandard densities must be defined with this command.
             
             The first argument to this command is the material name, which is
             always required; density is also required. The command to define
             an element (e.g. with non-standard density) is:
                 material H2 Z=1 A=1.01 density=0.000090
             A mixture or compound is a combination of known materials and/or
             elements; the command is:
                 material water H,0.1119 O,0.8881 density=1.0
             The numbers following the element names are their mass fractions
             (note that WATER is available from the NIST db). Either type of
             command can optionally have: pressure, temperature, state.
             
             With no arguments, this command prints the current material
             table. Note that 'G4_' is prepended to the names of most
             materials that are obtained from the NIST database; 'G4_Al' and
             'Al' refer to the same material (unless one was previously
             defined using this command).
             
             The following three arguments permit track filtering for all
             volumes made of this material:
               keep    A comma-separated list of particle names to keep.
               kill    A comma-separated list of particle names to kill.
               require An expression that must evaluate nonzero or the track
                       is killed.
             The require expression uses global coordinates and can use the
             followng track variables:
               x,y,z,Px,Py,Pz,t,PDGid,EventID,TrackID,ParentID,wt
             
             The following materials are known from the NIST database, and
             will be automatically created on first use:

                           (default=r).

multipole    construct a generic multipole magnet.

             Multipole magnetic fields from dipole through dodecapole are
             implemented with a cylindrical field region and optional
             surrounding iron (ironLength=0 or ironRadius=0 omits it). All
             fields with positive strengths are oriented so in the X-Z plane
             for X&gt;0 (beam left) the field is purely By. Negative strengths
             are allowed and reverse the field. The fringe field computation
             is not implemented.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             fieldLength   The length of the field region (mm)
             ironLength    The length of the iron (mm)

             kill          Set nonzero to kill tracks hitting the iron.
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             fringe        Fringe field computation, set to 0 to disable
             fringeFactor  Fringe depth factor (1.0).
             openAperture  Set nonzero to omit the aperture volume. #

muminuscapturefix Fixes up the G4MuonMinusCapture process.

             This class adds extra neutrons to mu- capture. The neutrons are
             added with a Poisson distribution having a mean of
             neutronMeanNumber, and with an exponential distribution in
             kinetic energy:
                 (1/neutronMeanEnergy)*exp(-KE/neutronMeanEnergy)
             As the muonic atom cascades to its ground state it forgets the
             incident mu- direction, so the extra neutrons are generated
             isotropically in the lab.
             
             The extra neutrons are added only to those captures that are
             hadronic (i.e. not decay in orbit). The value of
             neutronMeanNumber should reflect this.
             
             The default values correspond to Aluminum.
             
             NOTE: the Geant4 processes have changed since this command was
             designed and validated, and they believe this command is no

muonium      Define the muonium (Mu) particle and processes.

             Muonium is an atom, and there are lots of detailed atomic physics
             processes that are NOT modeled here. This is good enough to model
             muonium transport in vacuum, and adsorbing, reflecting, or
             stripping at a surface; nothing else is modeled, and these are
             only approximated and parameterized. The ionization energy of Mu
             is known to be within 0.5% of Hydrogen (13.6 eV).
             
             MuoniumDecay: the Mu lifetime is the same as for mu+; it is split
             into an e- and a decaying_mu+. In the Mu rest frame they have
             equal and opposite momenta in a random direction; they share 13.6
             eV of KE, with the ratio from a classical orbit. The decaying_mu+
             is a mu+ which decays immediately.
             
             MuoniumSurface: handles stripping, reflecting, and adsorbing at a
             surface; parameters are stripMFP, minDensity, E1, E2, E3, and E4.
             The mean-free-path for stripping is ASSUMED to be independent of
             KE and material; the default value is from [1] (silica aerogel).
             If the material being entered has a density &lt; minDensity, the Mu
             is transported WITHOUT ENERGY LOSS. Otherwise its KE determines
             which process applies: if KE&lt;E1, it is adsorbed or reflected; if
             KE&gt;E2 it is stripped; between E1 and E2 the probabilities are
             linear. If it is not stripped, then if KE&lt;E3 it is adsorbed; if
             KE&gt;E4 it is reflected, and between E3 and E4 the probabilities
             are linear.
             
             For stripping and decay the Mu polarization is transferred to the
             mu+.

ntuple       Define an NTuple containing multiple detectors.

             An ntuple holds the data from multiple detectors in a single
             NTuple, with one row (entry) per event or per track. This permits
             the generation of plots that compare different detectors. Up to
             64 detectors can be used. While 'detector' is used in this
             description, any existing NTuple can be used, generated by any
             command, such as: virtualdetector, zntuple, beamlossntuple,
             timentuple, and newparticlentuple.
             
             There are two ways the detectors can be combined: the default
             method is to construct a new NTuple that combines the fields of
             all the detectors, each prepended with the detector name. If
             union=1 is given, then all detectors must have the same list of
             fields, and that list is used for this NTuple; any hit in any
             detector is simply copied to this NTuple -- this permits multiple
             detectors to be combined into a single NTuple (you may want
             noSingles=1 for the detectors). With union=1, the 'required',
             'veto' and 'minHit' arguments cannot be used.
             
             By default, an entry in this ntuple is made for each event
             satisfying the require, veto, and minHit conditions; if
             perTrack=1 then an entry is made for each track that satisfies
             the require, veto, and minHit conditions. Any hit in any detector
             matching the patterns in veto will prevent the event/track from
             being entered into the ntuple.
             
             If multiple hits occur in a given detector during the event or
             track, only the first one is kept in this ntuple. Detectors are
             specified by patterns identical to UNIX file-matching, so '*Det*'
             matches any detector with 'Det' anywhere in its name, etc. The
             'required' argument permits events to be omitted unless all of
             the matching detectors were hit at least once in the event or
             track. The patterns in 'required' are applied only to detectors
             in the ntuple, so a simple '*' only matches detectors named in
             the 'detectors' argument.
             
             If union is nonzero, the hits in each detector are entered into
             this NTuple as they occur; each hit in any detector is included
             as a row in this NTuple. All detectors must have the same fields,
             which are used for this NTuple.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             NOTE: the name of a detector is by default the concatenation of
             its ancestors' names before its own (except World), unless
             rename=NAME was used in its place command. The patterns are
             applied to the names of the virtualdetectors as they were placed
             (including rename), not the bare name of the virtualdetector
             command. If 'rename=det#' was used when placing the
             virtualdetector-s, you probably want a * to match the #, or list
             them individually (det1,det2,det3...).
             
             NOTE: This command does not work correctly in collective tracking
             mode, unless union=1.

                           patterns(default=*).
             veto          A comma-separated list of detector patterns, any
                           hit cancels entry into the NTuple (default='').

output       redirects stdout and stderr to a file

             output requires one argument, the new output file. Any output
             generated before this command will not appear in the file, so
             this command should come at the start of the input.file, preceded
             only by setting parameters. After the redirection, it will
             re-print the G4beamline version and the current parameter values
             to the file. The most common usage is to redirect output to a
             file named like the .root file, when that is determined by
             parameter values:
                 param -unset param1=1.0 param2=3.0
                 param histofile=$param1,$param2
                 output $histofile.out

param        Defines parameter values.

             Parameters are named strings used to parameterize the input file;
             a few are used for program control. Parameters are set by the
             param commend, and on the command line (all program arguments
             after the first are interpreted as name=value).
             
             'param name=value ...' defines parameters. If no arguments are
             present, all parameters are displayed. If the first argument is
             '-unset', this command will not overwrite parameters that are
             already set (e.g. from the command line - this permits the
             input.file to set defaults that can be overridden on the command
             line).
             
             Parameters are expanded only in the arguments of commands: 'cmd
             argname=$paramname [...]'; real-valued expressions for arguments
             can use $paramname as a value, as long as paramname contains a
             valid real expression.
             
             Parameters are most useful for setting global things like viewer
             and histoFile, or as parameters used in the input.file.
             
             When a parameter is used, if it has not been defined, it will be
             defined from the environment if possible; if it is not defined in
             the environment then this generates an error message.
             
             The values of parameters are strings, but if the value of a
             parameter is set to a valid real expression including at least
             one operator {+-*/^&lt;&gt;=()!~&amp;%|?}, the parameter value will be set
             to the numerical value of the expression to 8 significant digits.
             
             NOTE: pre-defined Program control parameters (listed below) are
             defined before the command-line and are not affected by -unset.

viewer can be just a name, in which case the Geant4 /run/beamOn command 
must be used to generate events to be displayed. viewer can also have two 
or three parts: 'name,1,1' where the first 1 is the number of events per 
image and the second 1 is the number of images to generate. For the 'best'
viewer, which is Open Inventor, 999999 images are generated, and the user
does File/Escape to advance from one image to the next.

particlecolor Set the colors for tracks by particle name.

             Arguments are of the form 'name=1,1,0', where name is the
             standard name of a particle, and 1,1,0 is the R,G,B value desired
             for its color ('' or 'i' for invisible). The special names plus,
             minus, and neutral will set the colors for unnamed particles by
             their charge (default to blue, red, green). The name reference
             will apply to the reference track(s) (defaults to invisible).

particlefilter Will kill particles from a list, or force particles to decay.

             A particlefilter will force the decay of certain particles when
             they enter the physical volume of the element. The list of
             affected particles is in the 'decay' argument, and the normal
             Decay process is disabled for them. In addition, the 'kill'
             argument is a list of particles to kill when they enter the
             element, and the 'keep' argument will kill all particles not
             named, if it is not empty.
             
             require is an expression invloving track parameters that will
             kill the track if it evaluates to zero (use a comparison
             operator). The variables available are:
                 x,y,z,t,Px,Py,Pz,Ptot,PDGid,EventID,TrackID,ParentID
             Units are mm, ns, MeV/c.
             
             If nWait &gt; 1, particles will not be killed until they hit this
             element nwait times; this can be used to limit the number of
             revolutions around a ring. Decays are unaffected by nWait.
             referenceWait does the same for the reference particle The
             element can be either a cylinder or a box: set length and radius,
             or set length and width and height.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

particlesource Interface to the Geant4 General Particle Source.

             The Geant4 General Particle Source (GPS) is a very flexible and
             general way to generate events. It is controlled by Geant4
             commands which should follow this command in the input.file. If
             you have a macro, you can include it using either the G4beamline
             'include' command or the Geant4 command '/control/execute'. Note
             that G4beamline only recognizes Geant4 commands when the '/' is
             in column 1.
             
             Due to the design of the GPS, only one particlesource command can
             be used, but the GPS permits multiple sources to be combined.
             
             NOTE: the Geant4 General Particle Source inherently uses global
             coordinates, so this is most useful at the beginning of a
             beamline when global=centerline. Note also that it is very easy
             to generate a beam headed in the -z direction (this command will
             rotate to the +z direction: '/gps/ang/rot1 -1 0 0').
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             To use this, see the User Manual for the GPS at
             http://reat.space.qinetiq.com/gps

             Named Arguments:
             nEvents       Number of events to process (default=1), set to
                           lastEvent-firstEvent+1 if both are set.
             firstEvent    First event # to process (default is the next
                           sequential eventID, 1 if none)
             lastEvent     Last (highest) event # to process
             secondaryTrackID The next TrackID for secondaries (1001).

physics      Defines the physics processes and controls them.

             Exactly one physics command must be present. This command
             implements the geant4 physics lists of physics processes. The
             command is 'physics QGSP' for the QGSP list, and similarly for
             the other lists. With no argument it prints the available physics
             lists. 'default' will select a standard list, currently
             FTFP_BERT.
             
             Note that stochastic processes are always disabled while tracking
             the tune and reference particles. The only non-stochastic
             processes are Transportation and ionization energy loss (with
             fluctuations disabled).
             
             For muon beam studies you may want to disable the Decay process.
             
             spinTracking=1 will enable tracking the spins of e+, e-, mu+, and
             mu- (only), including pion decays to polarized muons, polarized
             muon decays, and the force from the particle's magnetic moment.
             The rare pion decay to e nu is included, but the e are
             unpolarized. The muon decays give the correct distribution for
             the electron, but only approximate distributions for the
             neutrinos, and all are unpolarized.
             
             NOTE: this command defines the particles used throughout the
             simulation, so this command must come before others that use
             particle names.
             
             NOTE: the rare decay mode for pi+/pi- to e nu is always added,
             with branching ratio 1.230E-4.
             
             The default all-around physics list for HEP is called
             'FTFP_BERT'.
             
             NOTE: At present there is a bug in Geant4 tracking and the
             magnetic moment is not used. For &gt;~ 0.1 GeV muons and practical
             fields this is a very small error.
             
             NOTE: the RadioactiveDecay process is added to all ions.

             Named Arguments:
             disable       Comma-separated list of processes to disable (e.g.
                           'Decay,msc').

             deactivate    Synonym of disable.

             fluct         Set to zero to disable ionization energy loss

                           the physics list for mu- and mu+ NOTE: This is

             ----- PHYSICS LISTS -----

             Further guidance in selecting physics lists is available at:
             http://geant4-userdoc.web.cern.ch/geant4-userdoc/UsersGuides/PhysicsListGuide/html/index.html
             
             The default all-around physics list for HEP is 'FTFP_BERT'.
             
             Each basic physics list uses the standard Geant4 electromagnetic
             physics Opt0. This can be changed by adding one of these suffixes
             (the best but slowest is _EMZ):
             _EMV EM Opt1 less precise but faster.
             _EMX EM Opt2 less precise but faster.
             _EMY EM Opt3 it uses a set of EM processes with accurate
                  simulation of gamma and charged particle transport. Only the
                  Urban multiple scattering model is used for all charged
                  particles and all energies. Slower.
             _EMZ EM Opt4 the best set of electromagnetic physics models
                  selected from the low energy and standard packages. With its
                  concentration on the best possible physics, electromagnetic
                  option 4 is slower than the standard EM package.
             _LIV is made on top of electromagnetic option 3 by substitution
                  of standard models for gamma and electrons from Livermore
                  set of models.
             _PEN is made on top of electromagnetic option 3 by substitution
                  of standard models for gamma, electrons and positrons from
                  Penelope-2008 set of models.
             _GS is made on top of the default electromagnetic configurations
                  by substitution of the Urban multiple scattering model for
                  electrons and positrons by the Goudsmit-Saunderson model.
             _LE is made on top of the default electromagnetic configurations
                  by substitution of the Urban multiple scattering model for
                  electrons and positrons by the LowEWentzelVI model. Also,
                  using 5D gamma conversion model and Lindhard-Sorensent model
                  for ion ionisation.
             _WVI is made on top of the default electromagnetic configurations
                  by substitution of the Urban multiple scattering model for
                  electrons and positrons by the WentzelVI model and ATIMA ion
                  ionisation model.
             _SS is made on top default electromagnetic configurations by
                  substitution of all multiple scattering models by single
                  scattering models.
                  
             The basic physics lists specify the hadronic modeling (can add EM
             suffix):
             FTFP_BERT The current Geant4 default, good for most HEP users.
             QBBC      Recommended for medical and space physics simulations.
             QGSP_BERT The former Geant4 default, good for most HEP users.
             QGSP_BIC  Another list for HEP.
             Shielding Recommended for simulation of deep shielding. Neutrons
                      of 20 MeV and lower use the High Precision neutron
                      models and cross sections to describe elastic and
                      inelastic scattering, capture and fission. The G4NDL
                      database is required for this physics list.

                    simulation for low-energy transport of protons and
                    neutrons is needed. It usually produces the best agreement

pillbox      Defines a pillbox RF cavity

             A Pillbox RF cavity is the basic RF element used to construct a
             linac. The phaseAcc parameter sets the phase of the tune particle
             at the center of the cavity, and the timing offset of the cavity
             is determined from that the first time that the Tune particle is
             tracked through the cavity. Zero degrees is the rising
             zero-crossing of the Ez field. If timeOffset is specified, it is
             used rather than setting it from the Tune particle.
             
             The Pipe, walls, and collars are always made of copper. Pipe,
             wall, collar, win1, and win2 can be omitted by setting their
             thickness to 0. Common usage is to set the collar values so by
             placing multiple pillboxes sequentially the collars form a beam
             pipe between them.
             
             Note that section 4.4 of the User's This element must be placed
             (via the place command).
             
             Guide has a dimensioned drawing of a pillbox.

                           walls, or collars (0).

place        places an element into the current group (or world).

             Every element can be placed multiple times into the beamline. For
             most elements the geometrical centerpoint is placed; for polycone
             the local x=y=z=0 point is placed. If front is nonzero then the
             front of the element is placed (and any rotation is applied at
             the front). If z is specified, then the element is placed at that
             z position relative to the center of the enclosing group. If z is
             not specified, then the element is placed immediately downstream
             (higher z) of the previous element in the group, or at the
             upstream edge of the group if this is the first element in the
             group.
             
             The 'rename' argument can be used to change the name of the
             element (applies to traces and other uses of object names, such
             as the NTuple name of a virtualdetector). When placing into a
             group or other object, the rename argument should normally begin
             with '+' to include the parent's name; otherwise multiple
             placements of the parent will generate multiple objects with
             identical names -- that should be avoided for output objects like
             virtualdetector. Without a rename argument, the parent's name is
             included automatically.
             
             When multiple copies are placed, z refers to the first, and the
             rest are placed sequentially along z. When placing an element
             into the World group, Centerline coordinates are used unless
             coordinates=global is present. When centerline coordinates are
             used, the parameter 'Zcl' is set to the highest Z value used;
             this is normally the Z value for the front of the next element
             when placed sequentially (i.e. with no z value given).
             
             Rotations: The rotation parameter can be used to rotate this
             element relative to the enclosing group. The object is rotated,
             not the axes. Rotations are specified as a comma-separated list
             of axes and angles (in degrees): rotate=Z90,X45 rotates first by
             90 degrees around Z and then by 45 degrees around X. The axes are
             the local X,Y,Z coordinate axes of the enclosing group
             (centerline or global coordinate axes for the World group);
             groups can be rotated when placed, and are rotated as a rigid
             unit (including children).
             
             If parent=name is present, then the name must be an element that
             accepts children, and it is used as the enclosing group; in this
             case the size of the group is implied by the size of the parent
             element, and z must be given (defaults to 0). Note that a given
             element cannot be the parent of any other element once it has
             been placed, so you must place children into their parent before
             placing their parent.
             
             If the special element 'OFFSET' is given, x, y, and z specify
             offsets for every following place command into the current group
             (incl. World), that gives a z position.

             Named Arguments:
             z             Z position of element's center relative to the
                           center of the enclosing group (mm).
             x             X position of element's center [default=0] (mm)
             y             Y position of element's center [default=0] (mm)
             parent        Parent element name (must accept children).
             rename        Name to use for this placement; '#' will be
                           substituted by the number of placements. If the
                           value begins with '+', it is replaced with the
                           parent's name.
             copies        Number of copies (placed sequentially along z).
             front         Nonzero to specify z for the front, not the center.
             rotation      Rotation of this object.
             coordinates   Coordinates: global or centerline (default=c).

polycone     construct a polycone with axis along z

             This is a direct interface to G4Polycone. For a solid polycone,
             omit innerRadius and it will be filled with zeroes. The number of
             entries in z, innerRadius, and outerRadius must be the same. Note
             that a polycone is placed at its z=0,r=0 point, which need not be
             its geometric center.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             innerRadius   Comma-separated list of inner radii (mm) #
             outerRadius   Comma-separated list of outer radii (mm) #
             z             Comma-separated list of z positions (mm) #
             initialPhi    The initial Phi value (deg; 0 for all)
             finalPhi      The final Phi value (deg; 360 for all)
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             material      The material of the polycone
             color         The color of the polycone (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.

printf       prints track variables and expressions

             This is an interface to the C printf() function. The first
             positional argument is the format, and the following positional
             arguments are double expressions printed with the % fields in the
             format. Up to 16 expressions can be printed. The print is
             performed only if the 'required' expression is nonzero, as each
             track reaches one of the Z positions in the 'z' argument
             (centerline coordinates). Multiple printf commands with the same
             'file' will be combined into the file as tracks reach any of
             their Z positions. More than 16 expressions can be broken into
             multiple printf-s with noNewline=1 for all but the last.
             
             The following variables can be used in expressions:
                x,y,z,t,Px,Py,Pz
                PDGid,EventID,TrackID,ParentId,Weight
                Bx,By,Bz, Ex,Ey,Ez
                tune (nonzero only for the Tune particle)
                reference (nonzero only for the Reference particle)
                beam (nonzero for any Beam particle)
             
             Each value in z and zloop can be an expression using double
             constants and the usual C operators and functions.
             
             Example:
              printf z=0 'Momentum is %.3f GeV/c' sqrt(Px*Px+Py*Py+Pz*Pz)/1000
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             NOTE: if format begins 'Ptot=...' the parsing will think it is a
             named argument; put a space before the '=' to avoid that error.

             Named Arguments:
             z             Comma-separated list of Z positions for printing
                           (mm)
             zloop         Loop in z, first:last:incr (mm)
             require       logical expression for cutting (default=true)
             file          Output filename (default="-" =&gt; stdout)
             filename      Synonym for file
             noNewline     set nonzero to omit final newline.
             coordinates   Coordinates: global, centerline, or reference
                           (default=c).

printfield   Prints E or B fields, or writes FieldMap file.

             Prints the value of the electromagnetic field components. For
             type=print, prints one component of the field in a 2-d table. Any
             coordinate plane can be printed (XY ... ZT). For type=grid or
             type=cylinder, writes a file in fieldmap format. Global
             coordinates are used. Units are Tesla for B and MV/meter for E.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             NOTE: This command cannot handle time dependency in the output
             BLFieldMap file, but can in the printout.
             
             Note: if you want to plot field vs position or time, the
             'fieldntuple' command is probably better, as it is not limited to
             the 2-d paper, is easier to use, and lets you use existing NTuple
             plotting tools. If you just want to test a few points, the
             'probefield' command lets you do that interactively.

             Named Arguments:
             type          print, grid, or cylinder.
             exit          Set nonzero to exit after printing field
             Arguments for type=print:

             dY            Interval in Y between points (mm).
             dZ            Interval in Z between points (mm).
             Arguments for type=cylinder:
             file          Filename to write fieldmap to.
             comment       Comment for fieldmap.

probefield   Prints B and E fields at specified points.

             Intended primarily for debugging. Prints Bx,By,Bz in Tesla, and
             Ex,Ey,Ez in MegaVolts/meter. Each input line is x,y,z,t separated
             by spaces or commas; omitted values are set to 0.0.
             
             Field Values are printed after the reference particle is tracked.
             Only global coordinates are used.
             
             Positional arguments are used as input lines before reading the
             inputFile.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             inputFile     Filename for reading list of points (- = stdin)
             outputFile    Filename for output (- = stdout)
             exit          Set nonzero to exit after printing field

profile      write beam profile information to a file

             This command accumulates the moments of the track distributions
             during the run, and at the end of run prints the mean, sigma,
             emittance (RMS), alpha, and beta (Twiss parameters) for the
             tracks. Each z position generates a line in the output file.
             
             Each value in z and zloop can be an expression using double
             constants and the usual C operators and functions.
             
             NOTE: This computation has two rather serious deficiencies:
               1) it includes all tracks, with no sigma cut, so a single
                  outlier track can have a large effect on sigmas and
                  emittances.
               2) its emittance does not include the vector potential.
             To avoid these deficiencies, it may be better to write NTuples
             and apply an external program such as ecalc9.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             z             Comma-separated list of Z positions for profiling
                           (mm)
             zloop         Loop in z, first:last:incr (mm)
             require       logical expression for cutting (default=true)
             particle      Name of particle to profile (default=mu+)
             file          Output filename (default=stdout)
             filename      Synonym for file
             coordinates   Coordinates: centerline or reference (default=c).

randomseed   control pseudo random number generator seeds

             This randomseed command controls the pseudo random number
             generator seed at the start of each event. The unnamed argument
             can be any of (case insensitive):
                EventNumber
                None
                Time
                Set 12345
                Now 12345
             EventNumber is the default and permits events to be re-run; None
             does not re-seed the PRNG at each event, and Time is like None
             after seeding with the time of day in microseconds; Set (Now)
             seeds the generator immediately with the value of the second
             argument (a long), and then acts like None.

             Named Arguments:
             print         Set to 1 to print the next random number at the end
                           of each event.

rdecaysource Generates a 'beam' from radioactive isotopes in the world.

             Scans the world for radioactive isotopes. If the isotopes
             argument is set, only those are used, otherwise all unstable
             isotopes are used. Unstable isotopes are decayed in place,
             wherever they appear in the geometry.
             
             The argument 'duration' specifies over what time interval (from
             t=0) generation will take place. The weighted sum of all
             generated tracks will be appropriate for the radioactive decay of
             the unstable nuclei in the world over that duration.
             
             This source has two modes: mode=1 is appropriate for use by a
             simulation program that handles radioactive decay itself; mode=2
             is appropriate for a simulation program that does not. mode=1
             preserves the time dependence of ion energy deposition, mode=2
             does not; both preserve the overall ion energy deposition (over
             all time).
             
             In mode 1 (default): this source generates all ordinary particles
             that are produced within duration of t=0. Unstable nuclei with
             lifetimes &lt; 1us have their kinetic energy saved, set to 0, and
             then are tracked so they decay. Stable nuclei, and unstable
             nuclei with lifetime &gt;= 1us are output and killed, adding any
             saved KE. This makes the approximation that no unstable nucleus
             moves significantly, but the energy deposited by ions is
             preserved, including its time dependence (within 1us).
             
             In mode 2: this source generates all ordinary particles and
             stable ions that result from the initial nuclear decay. Unstable
             nuclei in the decay chain are not output, but are tracked so they
             decay. This makes the approximation that no unstable nucleus
             moves significantly; its kinetic energy is forced to 0, and its
             original kinetic energy is added to the next stable ion that is
             output -- this preserves the energy deposited by ions (but not
             its time dependence), and avoids generating extraneous
             very-low-energy electrons.
             
             This source generates the appropriate weighted number of events
             for duration; if nEvents is 0, the appropriate number of events
             is generated so they have weight=1; if nEvents is set, that many
             events will be generated with weight set appropriately; duration
             and nEvents apply to the first radioactive decay, but not to
             subsequent decays in the chain. Note that to get the entire chain
             in mode=2, 'trackcuts maxtime=1E99' is normally needed, as
             radioactive decay is quite slow (can be gigayears).
             
             File format is always BLTrackFile (i.e ASCII).
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             verbose controls printout vebosity:
              0 print only event summary.
              1 also print summary of unstable nuclei in volumes (default).
              2 also print summary of tracks generated (one line per track).
              3 also print steppingVerbose.
              4 also print details of stacking action.
              5 track all particles regardless of mode (DEBUGGING - double counts).

             Named Arguments:
             isotopes      Comma-separated list of isotopes (default=All).
             duration      Duration of generation (1us).
             nEvents       Number of events to generate (default is however
                           many are generated during duration).
             mode          Mode of the source (see text).
             first         First EventID to generate (default=1).
             maxTime       Maximum time in lab (1E99 ns).
             verbose       Verbosity level of printouts (default=1).
             showMarkers   Set nonzero to display a marker at the origin of
                           each generated track.
             showDecayChain # events to display the decay chan (0).
             dump          Set nonzero to dump the ion table.

reference    Define a reference particle.

             The reference particle is nominally headed in the +Z direction.
             Multiple reference particles can be defined, at different
             positions, momenta, particle types, etc. All coordinates are
             centerline coordinates.
             
             If desired, the referenceMomentum will be tuned to a specific
             value at a later z position in the beamline by giving values for
             tuneZ, and tuneMomentum; tolerance can be set if desired.
             
             Normally used in conjunction with a 'beam' command.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:

             tuneMomentum  Desired momentum for momentum tuning.
             tolerance     tolerance for momentum tuning (0.001 MeV/c).
             noEfield      Set nonzero to make this Tune and Reference
                           particle not respond to E fields (ICOOL style)
             noBfield      Set nonzero to make this Tune and Reference

             P             Synonym for referenceMomentum

reweightprocess modify the cross-section of a physics process.

             This command will modify the cross-section of a physics process,
             modifying the track weights so that weighted histograms give the
             same statistical result as if the command were not used. Used
             properly, this can greatly reduce the variance of the result.
             
             Care should be taken to ensure that all regions that should be
             sampled actually are sampled. For instance, if ratio&gt;1 the
             interaction length will be reduced, and deep inside an absorber
             there may be no sampling because no simulated tracks ever get
             there, even though real tracks will. If ratio&lt;1 then the upstream
             regions of absorbers will be under sampled; this is usually OK,
             as the desired result is to increase the sampling deep inside the
             absorber.
             
             For ratio&gt;&gt;1 this command can be used to examine rare processes.
             This can induce multiple rare interactions in an event when
             normally none would be expected; the weights will still correctly
             correspond to the real interaction, even though the event
             topologies don't.
             
             This command cannot reweight any continuous process (e.g.
             multiple scattering, ionization energy loss, etc.) -- it will
             issue a fatal exception if applied to such a process.
             
             This command should not be applied to other processes that
             re-weight tracks (e.g. the neutrino command). Indeed it probably
             won't give the correct weights if any such process applies to the
             particle (except for itself, it cannot determine the unmodified
             interaction length of such procsses, which is needed to compute
             the weight).
             
             The re-weighting applies to both PostStep and AtRest processes,
             but some AtRest processes do not work with this re-weighting; for
             instance, Decay works properly in PostStep for a moving particle,
             but not for a stopped one AtRest. This is related to the Geant4
             limitation that exactly one process be active AtRest, and exactly
             one step be taken.

rfdevice     Defines an rfdevice (RF cavity)

             An rfdevice (RF cavity) is the basic RF element used to construct
             a linac. The G4beamline convention is that 0degRF is the positive
             going zero crossing of the electric field, so generally
             phaseAcc=90 (degRF) is on-crest.
             
             The timeOffset parameter, if set, fixes the overall global
             absolute timing of the cavity relative to time=0 of the
             simulation. If unspecified, 0degRF is determined via the
             timingMethod setting. The default, timingMethod=atZlocal, defines
             0degRF such that the test particle will arrive at the timingAtZ=#
             location then.
             
             For longitudinal cavities, timingMethod=maxEnergyGain emulates
             how most cavities in linacs have their overall timing determined;
             while maxX would be appropriate for a horizontal transverse
             deflecting cavity.
             
             Independent of how 0degRF is found, exactly two of the set of
             maxGradient, phaseAcc, and one fixed output quantity
             (fixMomentum, fixEnergyGain, fixTransitTime, fixXdeflection, or
             fixYdeflection) must be specified to deterimine the final
             rfdevice timing. For example, with maxGradient and phaseAcc set,
             the energy gain would be determined, while if maxGradient and
             fixEnergyGain were set, the phaseAcc would be determined.
             
             The pipe, walls, and collars are made of copper by default. Pipe,
             wall, collar, win1, and win2 may be omitted by setting their
             thickness to 0. Common usage is to set the collar values such
             that, by placing multiple rfdevices sequentially, the collars
             form a beam pipe between them.
             
             Note that section 4.4 of the User's Guide has a dimensioned
             drawing of a pillbox. Due to the presence of an (usually)
             invisible timing volume, care must be taken when placing objects
             within an rfdevice.

sample       Sample tracks into an NTuple.

             A sample generates an NTuple of any track when it crosses the
             local X-Y plane. By default either direction is sampled, but if
             dir=1 only Pz&gt;0 is sampled, and if dir=-1 only Pz&lt;0 is sampled.
             These are all in local coordinates. While this element does not
             define a volume, it must be placed via the 'place' command; the
             local origin is placed (and the local Z axis is rotated with the
             sample plane).
             
             The sample is taken for a disk defined by the specifiied radius
             from (x=0,y=0). If polygon is not empty, then it must be simple
             (edges do not intersect each other, no holes); only tracks inside
             it are sampled, and radius is set for the vertex furthest from
             the origin (the polygon need not include the origin, but sampling
             is most efficient if the local origin is near the center of the
             polygon). Remember that the +x direction is beam LEFT, +y is up,
             +z is along the beam.
             
             Note this element linearly interpolates the track to its plane,
             using pairs of steps which bracket the plane. So if tracks are
             not straight (EM fields, multiple scattering), be sure that
             maxStep in surrounding volumes is small enough for good results.
             
             This element does not affect tracking, but it can be placed along
             the side of a solid that does; tolerance is used to ensure that
             0-length steps when entering a daughter volume will not generate
             multiple samples.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command).

setdecay     Set lifetime, decay channels, and branching ratios for a particle's decay.

             The particle is specified by name as the first positional
             argument.
             
             The lifetime of the particle can be set, unless it is a
             short-lived particle (for which lifetime is fixed at 0 -- these
             are particles like quarks, Zs, and Ws). Units are ns.
             
             Decay channels are specified 'daughter1,daughter2=BR', where the
             daughter names are separated by commas, and the branching ratio
             is a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive); the order of daughters
             does not matter. The sum of all BRs must be 1.0. It is best to
             use existing channels for the particle, because the code for the
             decay distribution is retained; new decay channels are given a
             default phase-space distribution, which is probably valid only
             for a 2-body decay of a spin 0 particle. New channels are limited
             to 4 daughters. Note that all desired decay channels must be
             listed.

solenoid     defines a solenoid (a coil and current)

             A solenoid is a coil and a current. If alternate is nonzero, then
             each placement of the solenoid (or an enclosing group) will flip

spacecharge  Beam-frame Green's function space charge computation

             This is a space charge computation for bunched beams. It uses a
             grid in the beam frame to solve Poisson's equation via a Green's
             function with infinite boundary conditions; the E field is
             boosted back to the lab frame E and B for tracking.
             
             Macro-particles are used to enable the simulation of larger
             bunches than can be feasibly simulated as individual particles;
             the macro-particles have zero radius, but are pro-rated into the
             nearest eight grid points when placed into the grid. This
             computation can handle up to about a million macro-particles, but
             100,000 is more sensible for all but the simplest physical
             situations.
             
             The bunch is created from the beam tracks before tracking begins.
             There is one bunch for each reference particle. Particles in the
             bunch must be the same particle as the reference, must initially
             be within {dx,dy,dz} of the reference particle, and when boosted
             to the reference particle's rest frame must initially have beta &lt;
             maxBeta.
             
             After boosting the particles to the beam frame, they are placed
             into the grid, pro-rating to the eight nearest grid points. The
             grid is dynamically re-sized to keep the 99th percentile of the
             particles between 0.5 and 0.67 of the grid size. This maintains a
             reasonable balance between resolution of grid points within the
             bunch and covering all of the particles. Particles located at
             &gt;85% of the grid size do not contribute to the field computation,
             but are tracked using the field of the rest of the bunch (and
             other bunches).
             
             The grid has {nx,ny,nz} points; there is a small computational
             advantage to using powers of 2, but any values &gt;1 can be used.
             For efficiency, the convolution of the Green's function with the
             charge grid is performed using FFTs; the grid is doubled in each
             dimension with the proper symmetry applied to the Green's
             function, so the cyclical convolution of the FFTs gives the
             proper potential with infinite boundary conditions.
             
             Outside the grid an approximation is used. An approximation grid
             is constructed, with the same size of the Poisson grid, but using
             {nxApprox,nyApprox,nzApprox} points. Particles are placed into
             this approximation grid, and the mean position is kept as well as
             the charge. Approximation grid points with less than 1% of the
             total charge are consolidated with their inner neighbors. The
             non-zero approximation grid points are treated as point charges
             when computing the potential outside the grid. For reasonably
             Gaussian bunches, {7,7,7} are reasonable values for the
             approximation grid sizes.
             
             The E field in the beam frame is computed via the derivatives of
             the linear interpolating function using the eight nearest grid
             points, and is boosted back to the lab frame E and B for tracking
             by the usual Geant4 routines.
             
             Bunch particles that get destroyed cease contributing to the
             bunch. As the bunch particles are selected during start-up, no
             additional particles are ever added to a bunch. This algorithm
             handles multiple bunches of any particle types.
             
             NOTE: For now, the reference MUST be parallel to the Z axis.

spacechargelw Lienard-Wiechert space charge computation

             This is a space charge computation that uses macro-particles to
             simulate more particles than is feasible to track individually.
             Each macro-particle is tracked as a single particle, but its
             charge is multiplied by the macro-particle charge when computing
             the field. The radius of the macro-particle is used to avoid the
             singularity from a point charge; outside the radius the
             macro-particle is treated as a point charge; inside the radius
             the point-charge field is multiplied by (r/radius)^K (radius and
             K are parameters).
             
             The trajectory of every particle is kept, and when computing the
             field at a point, the intersection of the point's past lightcone
             with the trajectory is used to determine the field from the
             macro-particle; there is a loop over all particles except the one
             currently being tracked. This computation scales as N^2, where N
             is the number of macro-particles; that makes it computationally
             infeasible for more than a few hundred macro-particles. But for
             the particles used, it is correct to within the following
             approximations: a) using macro-particles, b) linearly
             interpolating between steps, c) omitting the radiation term in
             the L-W potential.
             
             The fields are computed using eq. 63.8-9 (p 162) of Landau and
             Lifshitz, _Classical_Theory_of_Fields_, ignoring the radiation
             term. The computed fields are used in the usual Geant4 tracking.
             Particle creation and destruction are handled properly.
             
             This algorithm is primarily intended to test other space charge
             algorithms.

             Named Arguments:
             deltaT        Time step (ns).
             radius        Radius of macro-particles (mm).
             charge        Charge of macro-particles (times particle charge).
             trackTwice    0=linear extrapolation, 1=track (0)
             verbose       Non-zero for verbose prints (0).
             K             Exponent for macro-particle density (1).
             ignoreFieldWhenTracking For testing only (0).

sphere       construct a sphere (or section of one)

             This is a direct interface to G4Sphere.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments:
             innerRadius   The inside radius of the sphere (mm)
             outerRadius   The outer radius of the sphere (mm)
             initialPhi    The initial Phi value (deg; 0 for all)
             finalPhi      The final Phi value (deg; 360 for all)
             initialTheta  The initialTheta of the sphere (deg, 0 for all)
             finalTheta    The finalTheta of the sphere (deg, 180 for all)
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             material      The material of the sphere
             color         The color of the sphere (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.

start        Define the initial start of centerline coordinates.

             If used, this command must come before any other command that
             puts an element into the world or affects the centerline
             coordinates (place, beam, corner, cornerarc, and reference
             commands). This command may not always be needed, but it is
             needed to eliminate the ambiguities in the global to centerline
             coordinate transform, and when simulating a ring to ensure that
             sensible values of the centerline coordinates are used.
             
             Note that the radiusCut is important to reduce or eliminate
             ambiguities in the global to centerline coordinate transform. It
             can also be used to 'shield' the beamline to prevent particles
             from taking unusual paths around the outside of beamline
             elements.

             Named Arguments:
             x             The global x position of the start.
             y             The global y position of the start.
             z             The global z position of the start.
             initialZ      The initial centerline z value.
             rotation      The initial rotation of the centerline.
             radiusCut     The radius cut for the initial segment (mm).
             ring          Set nonzero to indicate a ring is present.

survey       survey command.

             The survey command writes the coordinates of the front and rear
             points of each element to a file (stdout if '-'). For most
             elements the points written are the geometrical centers of their
             front and rear faces. Elements are all objects put into the world
             via the place command.
             
             Entries are sorted by Zfront. The format of each line is:
               command name Xfront Yfront Zfront Xrear Yrear Zrear
             
             Coordinates can be global, centerline, or reference (if present).

             Named Arguments:
             coordinates   Coordinate type (global).
             filename      Filename to write (-).
             file          Synonym for filename.
             coord         Synonym for coordinates.

tess         Alias for 'tessellatedsolid'.


tessellatedsolid construct a tessellatedsolid.

             A tessellatedsolid is defined by facets on its surface. Each
             facet is either a triangle or a planar quadrilateral, and the set
             of surfaces must be closed.
             
             The surface definition can be read from a file or from the
             input.file.Leading whitespace is removed, and '*' represents a
             series of 0 or more non-blank chars. The first word in the line
             describes its content:
              #*     comment (ignored).
              tess*  also ignored.
              v*     a vertex containing 3 doubles (x,y,z in local coords).
              V*     a vertex containing an integer and 3 doubles (index,x,y,z).
              f*     a facet, containing 3 or 4 indexes into the vertex array.
              end*   end of input (or EOF).
             
             The only requirement on order is that the vertices mentioned in a
             facet line must already be present in the vertex array. Each
             vertex is appended to the end of the vertex array; for VERTEX
             lines, large gaps in the sequence of indices will waste memory.
             The first vertex is entry 0.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.
             

             Named Arguments:
             filename      File to read for definition.
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             material      The material of the tessellatedsolid
             color         The color of the tessellatedsolid (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.
             debug         Set nonzero to display markers on surface.
             file          Synonym for filename.

test         test random number seeds.

             Test

timentuple   Construct an NTuple of tracks at a specified time.

             A time NTuple generates an NTuple of every track at a specified
             global time. It uses a linear interpolation in the step that
             straddles the required time, so accuracy will suffer for large
             steps. The NTuple uses centerline coordinates, if available.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.
             
             The standard NTuple fields are:
                 x,y,z (mm)
                 Px,Py,Pz (MeV/c)
                 t (ns)
                 PDGid (11=e-, 13=mu-, 22=gamma, 211=pi+, 2212=proton, ...)
                 EventID (may be inexact above 16,777,215)
                 TrackID
                 ParentID (0 =&gt; primary particle)
                 Weight (defaults to 1.0)
             
             The following additional fields are appended for format=Extended,
             format=asciiExtended, and format=rootExtended:
                 Bx, By, Bz (Tesla)
                 Ex, Ey, Ez (Megavolts/meter)
                 ProperTime (ns)
                 PathLength (mm)
                 PolX, PolY, PolZ (polarization)
                 InitX, initY, InitZ (initial position, mm)
                 InitT (initial time, ns)
                 InitKE (MeV when track was created)
             
             Valid Formats (ignore case): ascii bltrackfile dummy for009
             for009.dat root trackfile Extended asciiExtended rootExtended

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             time          The global time of the sampling (ns).
             format        The NTuple format (see above for list).
             filename      The filename of the NTuple.
             file          Synonym for filename.
             require       Expression which must be nonzero to include the
                           track (default=1) #
             coordinates   Coordinates: global, centerline, or reference
                           (default=c).
             referenceParticle Set to 1 to include the Reference Particle.

torus        construct a torus.

             This is a direct interface to G4Torus. The major radius is in the
             X-Y plane, with phi=0 along X.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments:
             innerRadius   The inner radius of the torus (mm)
             outerRadius   The outer radius of the torus (mm)
             majorRadius   The major radius of the torus (mm)
             initialPhi    The initial phi around major radius (0 degrees).
             finalPhi      The final phi around major radius (360 degrees).
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm)
             material      The material of the torus
             color         The color of the torus (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.

totalenergy  Print total energy deposited in selected volumes.

             At end of run, prints the total energy deposited in the selected
             volumes.
             
             Volume-name patterns are like UNIX filename patterns: e.g.
             '*[AB]*' matches any name containing an A or a B.
             
             Tracks that are killed have their kinetic energy summed into the
             volume where they were killed, unless they are killed because
             they leave the World.
             
             With ancestors=1, energy deposited in matching volumes is added
             into their ancestors; energy deposited directly into those
             ancestors is not summed into them unless their names also match.
             That is, if A is a child of B, but only A matches the list of
             volume-names, energy deposited into A will be reported in both A
             and B, but energy deposited directly into B is ignored.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             volumes       Comma-separated list of Volume-Name patterns (*)
             ancestors     Set nonzero to sum energy into all ancestor
                           (enclosing) volumess (0).
             enclosing     Synonym for ancestors.
             filename      Filename to write summary (stdout).
             file          Synonym for filename.
             verbose       Verbosity level (0).

trace        Specifies tracing of tracks.

             Generates a separate NTuple for each track, with 1 row per step,
             unless oneNTuple is nonzero (in which case all tracks are put
             into a single NTuple). So format=ascii generates one file per
             track with names generated by the pattern in filename (first %d
             is replaced by event #, second %d is replaced by trackId); for
             oneNTuple, the default filename is AllTracks.txt.
             
             Note that without a trace command no traces are generated, so to
             trace just the tune and reference particles include a trace
             command with no arguments.
             
             In collective tracking mode, oneNTuple must be nonzero, and the
             entries will be generated only at collective steps (usually at a
             specified deltaT).
             
             Unlike other NTuple commands, the require expression applies to
             entire tracks, not individual entries.
             
             The standard NTuple fields are:
                 x,y,z (mm)
                 Px,Py,Pz (MeV/c)
                 t (ns)
                 PDGid (11=e-, 13=mu-, 22=gamma, 211=pi+, 2212=proton, ...)
                 EventID (may be inexact above 16,777,215)
                 TrackID
                 ParentID (0 =&gt; primary particle)
                 Weight (defaults to 1.0)
             The trace includes the following fields:
                 Bx, By, Bz (Tesla)
                 Ex, Ey, Ez (Megavolts/meter)
             
             The following additional fields are appended for format=Extended,
             format=asciiExtended, and format=rootExtended:
                 ProperTime (ns)
                 PathLength (mm)
                 PolX, PolY, PolZ (polarization)
                 InitX, initY, InitZ (initial position, mm)
                 InitT (initial time, ns)
                 InitKE (MeV when track was created)
             
             Valid Formats (ignore case): ascii bltrackfile dummy for009
             for009.dat root trackfile Extended asciiExtended rootExtended

             Named Arguments (#=cannot be changed in place cmd):
             nTrace        Number of tracks to trace.
             format        Format of the NTuple (see above for list).
             oneNTuple     Nonzero to put all traces into a single NTuple.
             primaryOnly   Nonzero to trace only primary tracks.
             traceTune     Nonzero to trace tune tracks (default=1).
             filename      Filename (Ev%dTrk%d.txt or AllTracks.txt).
             file          synonym for filename.

                           (default=1) #
             coordinates   Coordinates: global, centerline, or reference
                           (default=c).

trackcolor   Alias for 'particlecolor'.


trackcuts    Specifies per-track cuts.

             Applied to each track before tracking, and at each step.
             
             NOTE: the physics command MUST come before trackcuts.
             
             This command is not placed into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             kill          List of particles to kill (comma separated).
             keep          List of particles to keep (kill all others).
             killSecondaries Set nonzero to kill all secondaries.
             kineticEnergyCut Minimum K.E. to track (0 MeV).
             kineticEnergyMax Maximum K.E. to track (infinite MeV).
             maxTime       Maximum lab time to track (1000000 ns).
             keepPrimaries Set nonzero to keep tracks with ParentID==0
                           regardless of other tests.
             steppingVerbose Set nonzero to print kills (defaults to parameter
                           value).

tracker      Defines a tracker.

             A tracker consists of several trackerplane-s and can fit a track
             to wire hits and times in the trackerplanes. This is a simple
             algorithm that does not handle backgrounds or multiple hits. It
             assumes that every track hits each trackerplane at most once. It
             is intended to be used to explore resolutions and the effects of
             survey errors. A tracker is a logical combination of its
             trackerplanes -- the tracker cannot be placed, but its
             trackerplanes must be placed into the system.
             
             The fitting algorithm used requires that all of its parameters
             have comparable scales, so the 'scaleX', 'scaleXp', 'scalePtot',
             and 'scaleT' arguments should be set to the approximate sigmas of
             the tracker. They should be within a factor of 10 of the actual
             values, but closer is better. At the end of fitting tracks a
             summary is printed that flags each parameter with 'RESCALE' if
             its scale is too different from its sigma (factor of 5 or more).
             
             NOTE: if the tracker cannot measure Ptot, then 'scalePtot' MUST
             be set to zero. If the tracker cannot measure T, then scaleT MUST
             be set to zero. Parameters with zero scales are held fixed at
             their true-track values.
             
             NOTE: the trackerplane-s of a tracker MUST be placed in the order
             that particles will hit them; the code does not sort them.
             Usually this means that each place command of a trackerplane must
             have a larger z value than the previous place command. They must
             also come after the trackerZ value of the tracker command.
             
             A tracker has 3 modes of operation:
                true      Each track of each event is written to a
                          TrackerHits NTuple if it hits all trackerplanes;
                          the NTuple includes both the true track values
                          and the individual wire hits for each trackerplane.
                fit       A track is fit to the wire hits from a previous
                          run, and the fit track is written to a TrackerFit
                          NTuple (includes true values).
                ignore    Any track is ignored.
             
             See the 'trackermode' command to control the mode of trackers.
             
             The TrackerHits NTuple written in 'true' mode contains:
               true_x, true_y, true_z, true_Px, true_Py, true_Pz, true_t, 
               true_PDGid, true_EventID, true_TrackID, true_ParentID, 
               true_Weight, ... plus 1 hit and 1 time per trackerplane.
               (the first 12 are the same as a BLTrackFile.)
             
             The TrackerFit Ntuple written in 'fit' mode contains:
               x, y, z, Px, Py, Pz, t, PDGid, EventID, TrackID, ParentID,
               Weight, ChisqPerDF, nDF, nHit, nIter, true_x, true_y, true_z, true_Px,
               true_Py, true_Pz, true_t.
             (the first 12 are from the fit and are the same as a
             BLTrackFile.)
             
             The parameters of the fit are: x, y, dxdz, dydz, Ptot, time. You
             must ensure that there are at least as many data points as free
             parameters (scaleT=0 fixes time; scalePtot=0 fixes Ptot). Each
             trackerplane with nonzero wireSpacing provides a data point; each
             trackerplane with nonzero sigmaT provides a data point;
             trackerplanes that measure both provide two data points. You must
             have enough trackerplanes to meet this requirement, and must set
             minHits large enough to meet it. The TrackerFit NTuple has a
             field nDF that gives the number of degrees of freedom for the
             fit, which is defined as (#DataPoints)-(#FreeParameters); it also
             has nHit which gives the number of trackerplane-s hit.
             
             Note the tracker can simulate survey errors -- see the
             'trackerplane' command for details (each plane can have different
             errors).
             
             Both the true and the fit tracks are reported at reportZ, which
             defaults to the Z position of the tracker.
             
             Note that beamlossntuple and newparticlentuple will get many
             entries per track when used in mode=fit -- the fit runs the track
             many times through the tracker (30-100, up to maxIter).
             
             NOTE: the trackermode command must preceed all tracker commands
             in the input file, and each tracker command must preceed all of
             its trackerplane commands. The trackerZ value must also preceed
             all trackerplane-s, but reportZ can be equal to or anywhere after
             trackerZ.
             
             Note that each trackerplane must have a unique name. This means
             you should either have a separate trackerplane command for each
             one (with unique name), or use the rename= argument to the place
             command (again with unique name). If you use groups for
             trackerplane-s, use rename=+ in the group.
             
             NOTE: This command does not work properly in collective tracking
             mode.

             Named Arguments:
             trackerZ      The Z position of the tracker (Centerline, mm).
             reportZ       The Z position at which fit tracks are reported
                           (Centerline, mm, default=trackerZ).
             scaleX        Scale for X and Y (mm); default=1mm.
             scaleXp       Scale for dxdz and dydz (radians), default=0.001.
             scalePtot     Scale for Ptot (MeV), default=0. Set to 0.0 if
                           tracker cannot determine momentum.
             scaleT        Scale for t (ns), default=0. Set to 0.0 if tracker
                           cannot determine time.
             minPz         Minimum Pz for valid tracks (default=10 MeV/c)
             minHits       Minimum number of hits for fitting (# planes).
             tolerance     Track fitting tolerance (mm) (default=0.01 mm)
             maxIter       Maximum iterations during fitting (default=200).
             verbose       0=none, 1=result, 2=iterations, 3=detail,
                           default=0.
             format        Format of output NTuple.
             filename      Filename of output NTuple.
             for009        Set nonzero to also output TrackerFit as
                           FOR009.Dat.
             file          Synonym for filename.

trackermode  Sets mode for all trackers, manages track fitting.

             USAGE: trackermode mode [file=...]
              mode can be any of:
                 true     tracks true tracks (normal operation)
                 fit      fits tracks to previous 'true' output
                 both     does both true and fit at once
             'fit' requires the filename argument to be the output of a
             previous 'true' run (filename is ignored in other modes); each
             tracker processes all of its tracks in the file. 'true' mode
             simply denotes the standard G4beamline operation, and the
             simulated tracks are taken to be the 'true' tracks of the system;
             the response of the tracker(s) to these tracks is then simulated
             in 'fit' mode. 'both' tracks a 'true' event, and then a fit is
             peerformed in each tracker for which its first track hit all
             trackerplane-s.
             
             Note that in 'true' mode every track that hits all trackerplane-s
             is considered, but in 'both' mode only the first track of the
             event can be considered.
             
             In fit mode, the filename argument MUST be different from the
             parameter 'histoFile', because this run must not overwrite the
             Root file from the previous (true) run.
             
             One trackermode command controls the mode of all trackers. 'true'
             mode is normal G4beamline operation, and is the same as if no
             trackermode command was present.
             
             Note that the geometry of the system must not change between a
             'true' run and a 'fit' run. You can, however, make small
             variations in fields to explore how errors in setting them will
             affect the fitted tracks. The trackerplane command can simulate
             survey errors.
             
             NOTE: the trackermode command must preceed all tracker commands
             in the input file.

             Named Arguments:
             filename      Filename to read for fitting tracks.
             file          Synonym for filename.

trackerplane Construct a tracker plane.

             A trackerplane belongs to a specific tracker, and represents one
             measuring element of the tracker. While the term 'wire' is used,
             a trackerplane can model any planar measuring device that
             measures one dimension using equally spaced detectors that are
             either on or off (hit or not hit). A trackerplane can be circular
             (specify radius and possibly innerRadius) or rectangular (specify
             height and width).
             
             The wires are at angle theta from the vertical, so theta=0 means
             vertical wires that measure x; theta=90 means horizontal wires
             that measure y; theta=180 also measures x, but increasing x means
             decreasing wire #.
             
             Setting wireSpacing=0 means there are no wires, which is useful
             for a trackerplane that models a scintillator used for track
             timing (set sigmaTime &gt;= 0 to indicate that).
             
             sigmaTime&gt;0 means this plane can measure the time of the track
             with that resolution. A Gaussian random number is added to the
             true track's time at this plane when reading the TrackHit NTuple.
             
             Survey errors can be modeled using the err-arguments -- the
             values they specify are applied during trackfitting (but not for
             true tracks). errType: 'fixed' means error values given are the
             actual values, 'gaussian' means error values are the sigma of a
             Gaussian random number, 'rect' means error values are the
             half-width of a uniform random number. The random number is
             picked before the run begins; the random-number seed is set from
             the clock so every run will have different random errors.
             
             trackerplane has 3 modes:
               true    The trackerplane reports the hit wire and time to
                       the tracker;
               fit     The trackerplane reports the Chisq contribution of
                       the fit track distance to the true track's hit wire
                       center, plus survey errors (if any). The track time
                       also contributes to the chisq.
               ignore  Any track is ignored.
             
             NOTE: the trackerplane-s of a tracker MUST be placed in the order
             that particles will hit them; the code does not sort them.
             Usually this means that each place command of a trackerplane must
             have a larger z value than the previous place command. They must
             also come after the trackerZ value of the tracker command.

             Named Arguments:
             tracker       The tracker to which this plane belongs; REQUIRED.
             radius        The radius of the circular tracker plane (mm).

             This is a direct interface to G4Trap. The trapezoid is
             symmetrical left-right, but upper or lower width can be larger or
             smaller.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments:
             height        The height of the solid trapezoid (mm)
             upperWidth    The upper width solid trapezoid (mm)
             lowerWidth    The lowerWidth of the solid trapezoid (mm)
             Xul           X position of upper left corner (mm)
             Xur           X position of upper right corner (mm)
             Xll           X position of lower left corner (mm)

             color         The color of the trapezoid (''=invisible)
             kill          Set nonzero to kill every track that enters.

tube         Alias for 'tubs'.


tubs         construct a tube or cylinder with axis along z.

             This is a direct interface to G4Tubs, which can implement a tube
             or cylinder; either can subtend less than 360 degrees in phi.
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command), and children
             can be placed inside it.

             Named Arguments:
             innerRadius   The inside of the tube, 0.0 for cylinder (mm)
             outerRadius   The outer radius of the tube or cylinder (mm)
             initialPhi    The initial Phi value (deg; 0 for all)

             radius        Synonym for outerRadius (mm)

tune         Tune a variable used as argument to other elements.

             This command samples the Tune particle track at z0, samples it
             again at z1, and varies its tune variable in order to bring the
             expression to zero. The tune variable is the first positional
             argument, and can be used in the argument expression(s) for
             tunable arguments located after z0. Due to the simple solver
             used, there should be an approximately linear dependence between
             the tune variable and the expression. This is suitable for tuning
             the By field of a genericbend or the maxGradient of a pillbox. At
             each solver step the saved Tune particle is re-started from z0,
             and when it reaches z1 the next step in the solver is taken.
             
             Note that multiple tune commands can be used together, as long as
             their z0-z1 regions are properly nested by at least 0.5 mm (i.e.
             each pair of regions must either not overlap at all, or one must
             be wholly contained in the other). This command can be
             complicated to use; see the User's Guide for more description and
             examples.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.

             Named Arguments:
             z0            The starting z position in CL coordinates.
             z1            The ending z position in CL coordinates.
             initial       Initial value of the variable 'name'
             initialStep   Initial step (0 to disable tuning)
             step          Synonym for initialStep
             start         An expression that must be nonzero to start tuning
                           (default=1)
             expr          The expression to tune to zero
             tolerance     The tolerance for expr to be zero
             maxIter       The maximum number of iterations (10).

usertrackfilter Construct a usertrackfilter that filters tracks via user code.

             ...

             Named Arguments:
             radius        The radius of the circular element (mm).
             innerRadius   The inner radius of the circular element (0 mm,
                           solid).
             height        The height of the rectangular element (mm).
             width         The width of the rectangular element (mm).
             length        The length of the element (mm).
             maxStep       The maximum stepsize in the element (mm).
             material      The material of the element.
             color         The color of the element (''=invisible).
             filterName    Name of the UserTrackFilter.
             filter        Synonym for filterName.
             init          Initialization string passed to user setup().

virtualdetector Construct a VirtualDetector that generates an NTuple.

             A VirtualDetector generates an NTuple of any track when it enters
             the physical volume of the VirtualDetector. It may be placed via
             multiple place commands (usually with a 'rename=det#' argument to
             distinguish the different placements). If material is not
             specified, it uses the material of the enclosing element. Every
             placement creates an individual NTuple. For a circular
             VirtualDetector give radius; for a rectangular one give height
             and width; length is usually left at 1 mm, but can be set to
             correspond to the length of a physical detector. The NTuple by
             default uses centerline coordinates. The NTuple of the
             virtualdetector can be included in an ntuple command by including
             a pattern that matches its name in the 'detectors' argument to
             the ntuple command. Note that must match the name as placed (i.e.
             includes rename=), not the name given to this command. The
             noSingles argument may be useful in this case to avoid a huge
             NTuple of singles (an empty NTuple may be created).
             
             This element must be placed (via the place command).
             
             Note that secondary particles created within the virtualdetector
             will not get an entry until they have taken one step. They are
             guaranteed to do so.
             
             The standard NTuple fields are:

zntuple      Generate an NTuple for each of a list of Z positions.

             Generates an NTuple like a virtualdetector, but without a
             physical volume. Tracks are forced to take steps within 2mm
             surrounding each desired z position, and they are interpolated to
             the desired z position. Each z position generates a separate
             NTuple named Z123 (etc.). z accepts a list of z positions, and
             zloop can generate a set of equally spaced z positions; both can
             be used.
             
             Each value in z and zloop can be an expression using double
             constants and the usual C operators and functions.
             
             This command places itself into the geometry.
