<H2>Downloading Geant4 Data Sets</H2>
<p> <b>NOTE:</b>Before G4beamline can run, it requires that various Geant4 
data sets be downloaded and unpacked; which specific data-sets are required
depends on the physics list used in the input.file. When first run, 
G4beamline prompts the user to download them. If you find you need to
download more data-sets, click <a href="file:/G4blData">here</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="Intro"></a>
</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
G4beamline is a particle-at-a-time simulation program based
on Geant4 <a href="#References">[1]</a> and optimized for the simulation of
beamlines. See the G4beamline User's Guide at the above URL for a
description of the program (it is also installed with this distribution in
the doc directory).
<p>
This brief description only discusses how to use the program, it does not
describe how to construct a simulation's input file; for that see the
G4beamline User's Guide.
<a name="Using"></a>
</p><h2>Using the Program</h2>
Select the input file using the "Browse" button above, or via the File/Open menu.
The directory containing it will become the current directory, and the
output file will be "g4bl.out", which will be displayed in this space.
Any additional Parameters used by the input file can be entered above.
Pushing the "Run" button above will run the program, replacing this
text with its output.<br>
<br>
If you wish, you can enter a simple directory name into the "Directory"
field; that directory will be created and the output files placed into
it (including any NTuple output files). No '/' or '\' can be used.<br>
 
<p>
While the program is running, the "Run" button above will change to
"Abort" to permit you to stop the program immediately. Closing this 
window will also abort g4beamline.
</p><p>
After running the simulation (with viewer=none), the simulation usually creates
one or more Root files containing the NTuples. You can use the 
<a href="#HistoRoot">HistoRoot</a> program to generate histograms from these
files.
</p><p>
<b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b>
With a viewer selected, NTuple output files are not written. This includes both
.root files and ASCII files from vitualdetector-s, zntuple-s, etc.
</p><p>Several examples are provided in the distribution. They are
located in the "examples" directory under the install directory. In
Linux the install directory is usually in your HOME directory; in Mac
OS X it is usually in /Applications; in Windows a Copy of "G4beamline
examples" is placed into "Documents". When installing G4beamline, it is
helpful to put the G4beamlineExamples directory into your HOME or Desktop.<br>

</p><p>
<a name="Vis"></a>
</p><h2>Visualizing the system</h2>Un-checking the Visualization box
will run the simulation and write the NTuple files; checking it will
run the simulation and viewer without writing NTuple files.
Each image in the viewer is a single run containing the selected number of
events.
<p>
viewer=best will visualize the system using OGLSQt, a viewer based on the Qt library and OpenGL. The number at the top left is the number of events per run;
each run will be shown as a separate image; push "Start Run" to start a run.
For usage hints, see the "useful tips" tab.
</p><p>Other viewers can be used, see the View/Other menu item for details.</p>
<a name="HistoRoot"></a>
<h2>Using HistoRoot to Create Histograms</h2>
<P>G4beamline often generates Root files containing NTuples; it can also
generate ASCII files containing those NTuples. The Root program 
<a href="#References">[2]</a> can be used to analyze these files, generate
plots and histograms, etc.
</P><P>
Root is very general, and therefore quite complex; understanding C++
programming is essential to be able to use it directly.
The HistoRoot program makes it easy to generate plots and histograms from
Root and ASCII files containing NTuples. It is a GUI program implemented in
Root that requires no C++ programming by users. HistoRoot is available at
http://historoot.muonsinc.com;
it requires the spedific version of Root from that webpage.
G4beamline can create .root files without Root being installed, and you can
install Root and/or HistoRoot after generating them, if necessary.
