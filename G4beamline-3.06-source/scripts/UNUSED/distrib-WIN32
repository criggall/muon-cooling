#	distrib-WIN32 -- construct a distribution for Windows (build on Xp)
#
#	executed from top-level build directory, $1 = VERSION
#
#	WINDOWS ONLY: DISTRIB hard-coded (no version in directory name,
#	and the directory remains aftr this script exits -- run Advanced 
#	installer and then delete the directory)
#
#	This distribution is for Advanced Installer. Note that the VC++
#	libraries are handled as a Merge Module within the installer, so
#	no vcredist.exe is needed.
#
#	This version copies any .DLL-s that are present in bin
#	into the distribution. This implies that all necessary .DLL-s
#	should be install()-ed there in CMake.
#
#	NOTE: avoid using .. as that fails in the presence of symbolic links;
#	use `dirname "$PWD"` instead.
